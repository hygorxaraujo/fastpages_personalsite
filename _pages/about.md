**Hello! I'm Hygor**

I have a bachelor's and a masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science, both from [UFJF](https://ufjf.br).

I have worked as a Software Engineer in back-end and mobile development, and I also have
 experience working as a Systems Analyst.
My main interests are in Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, Software Engineering, and
 Software Architecture.
